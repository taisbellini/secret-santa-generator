# secret-santa-generator
Every year my mom and I are responsible of the raffle to the family's Secret Santa, because we are coders. Usually we just do it manually and pretend we programmed it. This year we may actually do things right.

# Version 1.0

It should only receive the names of the family members separeted by Family Group and retrieve a list of pairs:
```
Person1 -> Person2
```
It means _Person2_ is the Secret Santa of _Person2_.
